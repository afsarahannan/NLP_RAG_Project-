introduction to machine learning ,Machine learning is branch of Computer Science It focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn Machine Learning is an important field of data science There is too much data in the world for humans to process Classical Machine Learning is dependent on human Intervention sub-field of AI that uses algorithms trained on data to produce adaptable models to perform tasks   
deep learning ,deep learning can work with or without human intervention Human experts could determine the set of features to learn but not required Can do supervised and unsupervised learning subset of machine learning that uses layers of Neural Networks to do the most complex ML tasks   
artificial intelligence ,ai is an umbrella term for software that mimics human cognition to perform complex tasks Speech Recognition A lot of programs allow users to speak instead of typing This increases a program’s accessibility to the differently abled Also allows for a more natural interaction with computers Examples Google Assistant Speech-to-Text keyboards Customer Service The advent of ChatGPT and other chatbots have led to creation of customer service chatbots Computer Vision Everytime you take a picture AI is used to determine the best way to tune color exposure and lighting When the picture is taken AI is used to tag faces in the picture for various reasons Recommendation Engines Using past customer data AI models can help recommend content that customer likes to consume TikTok Youtube Instagram Facebook etc perfected the craft Advertisement platforms are built with the promise of connecting the right ads to the right user Fraud Detection Banks and other financial institutions use AI to spot suspicious transaction This is to protect their customers from malicious intent Email services also detect and delete fraudulent emails from entering your inbox      
how machines learn ,"Machine learning algorithms are used to either make a prediction or classify a given data input. The data may or may not be labeled A function is responsible to evaluate the prediction of a model with it’s true label Models are adjusted to reduce discrepancy between a known example and the model estimate Types of ML Learning supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning Supervised Learning This is the most popular method to train algorithms A labeled dataset is used to train algorithms The algorithm learns patterns from labeled data during training and predict outcomes for new, unseen data Can be used to learn classification or regression Trained models aim to generalize, by avoiding overfitting/underfitting Generalization: Model should generalize by learning the underlying patterns in the data, rather than memorizing the data exactly Overfitting: Occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and can only train well but test poorly. Model has memorized data Underfitting: Occurs when the model is too simple and has not captured the underlying pattern. Model did not learn Example of models that are used during supervised learning Neural Networks Naive Bayes Random Forest Gradient Boosting Unsupervised Learning An unlabeled dataset is used to train algorithms Used often to uncover hidden patterns or data grouping without human intervention Ideal for Exploratory data analysis Image and Pattern Recognition Example of models that are used during unsupervised learning Neural Networks K-means clustering Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)    "
